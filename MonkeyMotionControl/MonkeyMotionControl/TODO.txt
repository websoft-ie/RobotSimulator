### STREAMING & COMMANDS
# BUG STREAM RUN MOVE: Does not reach last point.
# BUG AIM TARGET From Home Center/Straightline lower bottom position not working. (Singularity?)
+ Commands Table -> Select 3 continuous adjacent Linear Moves -> button Convert to Circular Move. 
+ COMMANDS Edit Mode -> Implement edit method for Start entry.
* COMMANDS ADD Linear/Circular Move -> Point B Set/Blinking Red for pending SET reminder.
* Commands sequence function: Add Linear / Circular == ADD >>> point + segment / arc in simulator.
* Stream Start -> go to start position following reverse sequence.
+ Move Commands and Stream Tabs into new UserControls -> eg. Linear Move, Circular Move.
- Stream and Commands Table style fix for onLostFocus foreground text color is black -> change to orange?.
+ FOCUS CALCULATOR: Link Simulator CalculateFocusDistance >>> Sequence / MoveID <<< ToolController position updater.
	- A to B values interpolator, calcfocus(0-0.50)
+ FOCUS SEQUENCE GENERATOR: Calculate focus sequence stream values between Point A, B, C using simulator.
* REHEARSE Generate FIZ stream based on 3D sim tracking Focus distance values.
% STREAM RUN TUNING: INTERVAL=40 VEL=100 ACC=30 DEC=100 LV=400 RC=400


### RANGEFINDER 
- Bug hangs Main UI when connected -> Action that pop up MessageBox.
	- Case 1: Click on Go Home button.


### MOTION GRAPH
+ After REHEARSE / Generate focus curve -> using focus distance point data to shape the focus curve in the motion graph (interpolate?) 
OK - Timeline Add/First/Last keyframe link handles add behaviour to make Link handles horizontal.
- Keyframe Editing: Add button for copy and set current selected keyframe focus position.
+ MOTION GRAPH SETTINGS: 
	-> ADD DP for Triggers Target (Robot / EtherCAT / Trigger Box)
		-> Fixed Trigger Tracks (Camera, Trigger 1-8)
		-> Variable add trigger tracks according to selected target controller.
	-> ADD DP for Motion Control Target (EtherCAT / OpenCAN / Motion Box / DragonFrame) 
		-> Fixed Cubic Tracks (Focus, Iris, Zoom, Aux)
		-> Variable add cubic/linear tracks according to selected target controller.
OK TEST NEEDED --> BUG TEMPORATY FIXED - Focus Jump -> Timeline Navigate sync when reach keyframe point, focus value goes to 0. 
    BUG TRACED @ Timeline_OutputFIZ(double time)  
    //00:00:01:59:433 > Timeline OutputFIZ t = 1.1748651 => focus = -23958.1804542793
    //00:00:01:59:447 > Timeline OutputFIZ t = 1.17540565 => focus = -23955.1577227329
    //00:00:01:59:470 > Timeline OutputFIZ t = 1.1759462 => focus = 0

### LIVE CONTROLS 
* FINE TUNE: Motion smoothing. 
# BUG AIM TARGET From Home Center/Straightline lower bottom position not working. (Singularity?)
+ ADD Point Navigation -> adjust and save edited position to current point (ONLY POINTS ADJUSTMENT disregarding if curve or line).
+ TARGET TRACKING: Applies rotation adjustments when moving in live direction. Calculate the tilt/pan value of the robot.
	+ ENABLED -> Disables 3D Controls for Pan & Tilt -> Sync Simulator CalculateRotation. 
		+ X/Y axis Perpendicular PIP vector calculation for moving on the general xy axis direction
	+ Update Live Control Thread to send complete Joint position updates (New VAL3 function for Small increments MoveJ).
- Button graphics make bigger for easier click / mouseEnter.
- Gamepad Connect Bug.


### TOOLCONTROLLER 
- BUG: Lens Profile XML repeated Position Value cause OOR/NAN error when click position step buttons => Fix: Check for repeat Position Value
# Track Target Out of Focus -> Check camera point or lens offset is correct.
++ LENS DEADBAND CALCULATOR / CALIBRATION function:
	Moves focus one direction in intervals and records distance + positon, and the adjusted lens position value.
	FLOW: 	1 Move to all n interval Positions -> Record Mark
		2 From last point move in reverse order, Adjust to correct focus -> Record Mark
		3 Repeat for n intervals until reach beginning.
		4 Calculate position Deadband/Backlash.
	DEADBAND tuning / adjustment (OnTRTM1PositionChanged).
* LINK + TARGET TRACKING control behaviour. 
	-> Link Simulator and Target Tracking ON: Do nothing, Simulator will update target distance automatically.
	-> Link Simulator and Target Tracking OFF: use Simulator Camera to Target distance stream (new Focus Distance sequence generator).
	-> Link Motion Graph: Check and turn off Target Tracking OFF, use Motion Graph for Position Stream.
- SAVE LAST POSITION on exit. Restore position on open.
- Add Teradek Motor Response Setting Commands. 
- AUTO-CALIBRATE Lens after Lens Profile change.
++ AUTO LENS PROFILER
	- SOLUTION 1 LASER RANGE FINDER distance input 
		- Calculate distance: pythagorean theorem / right angle triangle 
			> Edge A (Unknown) distance from sensor center to target. 
			> Edge B (Constant) is height from center of sensor perpendicular to A.
			> Edge C (variable) is measured distance from Laser Range Finder.
			= Return value of A
	- SOLUTION 2 MANUAL Profiling
		- Routine:
			- Select close and far distance range to measure (closest and farthest points).
			- Move to each distance position
			- Adjust focus
			- Click Confirm -> Records Distance + Position into the Profile Table.
			- Move to next.
			- Repeat until end of range.


### NEW FEATURES
